The language template has been implemented into DigiOz Guestbook 1.4 and up. 
To use a different language, please choose a language file from the "language"
folder and open it in Notepad. Save your chosen language file as "language.php" 
in the same directory and you are good to go.

Please, DO NOT use Wordpad, Microsoft WORD, or any other word editing software
for this task. USE NOTEPAD ONLY!!!

If you would like to help us add support for other languages besides English to
the DigiOz Guestbook, visit http://bb.digioz.com and post a translation of guestbook
text in your native language there. 

Thank You - DigiOz Development Team
